  <abbr title="The word <em>nebula</em> comes from the Latin for <em>cloud</em>. Gazing upwards, Andromeda appears as a smudge on the night sky. It was a puzzling wisp for centuries before scientists identified it as a galaxy beyond our Milky Way.
 
               </br></br>But there are clouds in space. Super-hot concentrations of dust and gas, which create stunning images like the ‘Pillars of Creation’. Closer to home, interplanetary dust scatters sunlight, creating coronas and hazy night skies as it rains down into the Earth’s atmosphere.

    <abbr title="Summiting Scottish mountains at the end of the 19th Century, physicist and meteorologist C.T.R. Wilson admired the crown of diffused light around the mist and clouds. Back in his laboratory, he created a box that used supersaturated vapour in an effort to recreate the sublime beauty of what he had seen—a cloud chamber.
 
                 </br></br>While the chamber did create small clouds in a controlled space, Wilson also observed whizzing points of miniscule energy, which were made visible for an instant in the vapour of the clouds. His chamber showed the rocketing paths of cosmic rays after they had entered the Earth’s atmosphere from space.

    <abbr title="Capturing the sublime beauty of clouds was a staple of Romantic painting, from the meticulous observations of John Constable, to the drama of crepuscular rays piercing storm clouds in the works of Thomas Cole and J. M. W. Turner. For centuries, artists have been drawn to the majesty and ubiquity of clouds as rich symbolic cues for emotions and setting and tone.
 
                 </br></br>In Andrew Yip’s ‘Cloud Chamber I’ and ‘Cloud Chamber II’ (2019), clouds are no longer relegated to the horizon, but immersed within a simulacra forest. Approaching the work triggers a series of events within the digital terrarium that causes an eerie spherical cloud to pulse and grow. This kind of interactivity, where the viewer must participate to effect change, teases at the dually scientific and artistic desire to observe and record—and makes explicit that by doing so, our presence transforms the natural order of things, simply through the act of witnessing.

I find myself kicking out my legs and waving my hands—a pantomime of trampling the lush nature that shrouds the fog, attempting to elicit a response from the dense environment.
 
                 </br></br>To be present in front of this work is to become content for the work. While not fully immersed in the faux forest (it is, after all, just a screen on a wall), viewers are compelled to become participants, exercising control over the cloud and transforming the landscape on display. Despite the apparent pristine and untouched vista, the landscape is incomplete without an audience to manipulate it.

      <abbr title="The visualisation of the ‘Cloud Chamber’ forest, the delicate forms of Yip’s small ‘Algorithmic Organism’ sculptures, and the ghostly ‘Network’ x-rays of the gargantuan fig trees, are all secondary manifestations of an underlying code. The individual keystrokes of these works are each points of information, like points in space whizzing by in a manufactured vapour. But the combined materiality of all these points working together evolves into something greater—acting as a fluctuating, rhizomatic galaxy of particles. 

                   </br></br>For example, the miniscule points mapping out the Moreton Bay fig trees are arranged to take on the form of familiar aspects of our environment, while also employing more complex visual cues like colour and density to communicate deeper, unseen information about the interior and geo-spatial aspects of its ancient roots and branches.

    <abbr title="Movement and human density in the gallery influence the cloud, but the audience cannot manipulate that much more. There are countless pre-ordained patterns at play here, from the lack of sunset to the clockwork wind rustling the shrubs and the explosions of stylised flocks of butterflies.
 
                 </br></br>How does this inhibited control transform how we see ourselves in observing the sublime and uncanny at play? Interactivity creates emotional affect, but the lack of true autonomy pushes me away. In particle physics, this repelling is called annihilation—sub atomic particles, like those from the cloud chamber, colliding with their corresponding antiparticles and forging something new.

This rhizomatic, shifting, networked representation of reality taps into the ever-evolving complexity of science, as well as acknowledging the un-fixity of the human state in relation to our environment.
 
                 </br></br>Cosmic rays continue to rain down on Earth, but learning from them is difficult. Scientists still aren’t sure how often they fall, or where they come from. And this is compounded by the observation that they appear to fluctuate in quantity over time and space. Not unlike the aleatoric throbbing of the cloud in the forest.

   <abbr title="Could we consider the visceral body of the cloud as an attempt to render something tangible in a flattened snapshot of an imagined landscape? Could our interaction with the cloud, however untethered, be considered a touch or imprint into that landscape? The world displayed, by design, will never show the same thing twice, so is its irreproducibility in fact a way of considering it consistent and stable?
 
                </br></br>Then again, perhaps the binaries of inside/outside the work, of observer/influencer, of randomness/control, are no longer apt. The digital and analogue are both equally present here, just as we are both observers and participants in the work, we are equally within the forest and absent from it.
